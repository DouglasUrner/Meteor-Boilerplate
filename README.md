Meteor-Boilerplate
==================

A simple skeleton for Meteor applications.

## Usage

1. Grab a copy with `git clone` or create your own fork.
1. Remove .git (`rm -rf .git` in the root of your version) – assuming you didn't fork.
1. `git init` – again, assuming you didn't fork.
1. Tweak to your heart's content, or start building your app.

Feedback, pull requests, issues are all welcome.

## Packages Used

* [iron:router]() –
* [nemo64:bootstrap](https://github.com/Nemo64/meteor-bootstrap) –
	* [less]() – Bootstrap (as of 3.3.1_1) needs less, but does not include it.
* [accounts-password]() –
* [mrt:accounts-ui-bootstrap-3]() –
* [aldeed:collection2](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-collection2) –
* [aldeed:simple-schema](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-simple-schema#example) – included by collection2
* []() –


## Packages To Think About Using

* [alanning:roles](https://github.com/alanning/meteor-roles) –
* [useraccounts:bootstrap](https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/bootstrap) – an alternative to mrt:accounts-ui-bootstrap-3, at first blush it looks like a nice package, but it wasn't easy to get it working.
